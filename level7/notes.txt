its a .net AOT stuff so we will need to find a way to decompile it because this is not the same as the usual .net stuff and dnspy wont be able to decompile it right away

and other thing is that we can know about this .net AOT due to the only exported symbol being somethingsomethingruntime lol (check this from PEbear)

we also get a pcap, and i believe this pcap is the encrypted communication that we have to decrypt based on the code from fullspeed.exe

there are bcrypt stuff in the strings, maybe this has something to do with the encryption??


extracted version from strings -> 8.0.5+087e15321bb712ef6fe8b0ba6f8bd12facf92629



capa is so usefull in that we know the important function, can visualize here also https://mandiant.github.io/capa/explorer/#/analysis


found socket open connections and stuff through x64dbg
socket connection setup is on 0x00007FF7C7CAB539, change the ip value to 127.0.0.1, but dont forget to open a server first at 127.0.0.1:31337
