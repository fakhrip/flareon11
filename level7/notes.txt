its a .net AOT stuff so we will need to find a way to decompile it because this is not the same as the usual .net stuff and dnspy wont be able to decompile it right away

and other thing is that we can know about this .net AOT due to the only exported symbol being somethingsomethingruntime lol (check this from PEbear)

we also get a pcap, and i believe this pcap is the encrypted communication that we have to decrypt based on the code from fullspeed.exe

there are bcrypt stuff in the strings, maybe this has something to do with the encryption??
